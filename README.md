This a simple terminal banking application written in C++.
This program is made with file handling. So, if you want to use this program make sure you dont have a file named "database.txt" that holds important information
This program has:
- a Registiration process that takes you information input and adds it into a file
- a Login process that ask your ID(given by program not your real ID) and password and checks whether that information is correct then logs you in to the program
- a Menu that you can:
- - Withdraw mÄ±ney from your account
  - Deposit money from your account
  - Transfer money between accounts
  - Check your current balance


 This is a different version of the previous banking program that I made with C programming language. 
 Unlike the C version, This C++ version does not have a password hashing process. But instead this version has transferring money between accounts

 You can change the textFile variables name to your own wish to write the data wherever you want.
